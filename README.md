# Snake-Game
This project was done in unity thats why there is code for traversing scenes.
The main class that runs the game is "GameManger" where it sets a 2d map boundary and spawns an "apple" asset
that once eaten by the snake it spanws in a random location on the map and increments the snake size by one.
However if the snake hits itself or an obstacles the game is over.
There is also a score implemented where every apple collected, the score is incremented.
